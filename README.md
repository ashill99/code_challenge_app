### Challenges

There are several bugs in this application.  I'd like you to find and fix at
least three.  Once you've done this, open a Pull Request with your fixes and in
the description of the PR, tell me how you went about debugging each of the
issues you ran into.

### Bonus Challege

Fix the test suite (it's also buggy) and make sure it's covering the bugs you
found.
